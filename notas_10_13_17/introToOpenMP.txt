Compile and tell compiler to use OpenMP:

gcc -fopenmp program.c

Tell how many cores to use: (just bash)

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4					


Thread:

A thread is consisted by dividing a sector of the stack of memory, to run parallely a program and it shares memory from the heap, even with other threads.

Declare n threads to use:

omp_set_num_threads(n);

Fork:
Create or separate a thread into multiple threads which runs a piece of code in a parallel way.

Fork/split into a team of threads:

#pragma omp parallel
{
	//some shit here();
}

Every memory allocated outside the pragma will be on the heap and every thread will have access to them.

Measure time:

double omp_get_wtime();
